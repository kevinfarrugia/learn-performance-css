    By placing your stylesheets in the
    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
    of your page, you can avoid a Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). On the
    downside, this blocks the HTML parser from rendering the rest of the HTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    This demo contains a stylesheet with the most critical styles in the
    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
    and another stylesheet with less critical CSS—in this example the heading
    color—declared within the
    <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. You will notice that the page does not render
    until the CSS has downloaded, eliminating the FOUC we had on the previous
    demo. However, the page appears slower as nothing is shown to the user until
    the CSS file has finished downloading. The heading color changes to pink
    after the page has rendered as this stylesheet is placed inside the
    <code>body</code>
    and thus not render-blocking.

    <strong>Note that styles applied after render may result in a

  <p>
    If you observe the waterfall chart above, you should notice that the Start
    Render mark has now shifted to 2.2s, shortly after the render-blocking
    <code>style.css</code>
    has finished downloading.
